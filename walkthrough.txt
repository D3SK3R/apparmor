first move the index.html and revshell.php to the httpd directory:
  /srv/http
then start/restart httpd:
  systemctl start/restart httpd

get the machine's IP:
  ip a
and open the browser to that url

now, on the host machine, listen to connections:
  nc -tnlvp 2727
in the browser, run the revshell.php
  <machine IP>/revshell.php
it should pop up a shell on the attacker machine

now close that shell
copy the content of the abstractions folder to /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/
copy the folder httpd.d and the rule usr.sbin.httpd to the apparmor directoy:
  cp -r httpd.d /etc/apparmor.d/
  cp usr.sbin.httpd /etc/apparmor.d/

now enforce/enable the httpd rule:
  aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.httpd
and restart the httpd and apparmor services
  systemctl restart apparmor
  systemctl restart httpd

now on the host machine again, run a listener:
  nc -tnlvp 2727
and on the browser run that reverse shell
  <machine IP>/revshell.php
it shouldn't work because apparmor won't allow it to.

_______________________
to disable/remove the rule:

disable:
  sudo aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.httpd

remove:
  rm /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.httpd
  aa-remove-unknown
